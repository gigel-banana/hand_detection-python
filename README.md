# Short description

We developed an application using the following packages: MediaPipe, OpenCV, and PyQt5. For the graphical interface, We used QT Designer. OpenCV allows real-time webcam usage, while MediaPipe detects how many hands appear on the camera.

We used PyCharm with Python 3.10. We added the following packages: mediapipe 0.10.9, opencv-python 4.9.0.80, pyqt5-tools 5.15.9.3.3.

We use MediaPipe to analyze the type of hand.  
OpenCV allows us to use the webcam in real time.  
PyQt5 is used for the project's graphical interface. We also used QT Designer to create the GUI.  
We use `google.protobuf.json_format` to convert MediaPipe results into JSON format.

To run the code, you should make sure you have the photos in the same folder as the .py files..
